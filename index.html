            About Me
        </h2>
        <p id="p2">
            I served in the USAF from 1992 - 1996 as a Crew Chief on B-1b Bombers. Worked in manufacturing after the USAF for a couple of years before going to work
            on the family farm in Georgia in 1999. After leaving the farm in 2004 I moved to Iowa and began working as a contract test technican 
            for John Deere's Ag Managemnt Systems group (now Intelligent Systems Group). In 2006 I moved to Michigan with my fiance and started college at 
            Delta College majoring in pre-engineering. While going to school I began working as a contract CAD technician for Delphi Steering Systems.
            In 2009 My wife and I returned to Iowa and I started working on my BS at Iowa State University. While attending college I also worked part time 
            as a contract Warranty Analyst for John Deere's Intteligent Solutions Group until my graduation in 2013 with a BS in Ag Systems Technology. In 2014
            I was hired as a contract test engineer at John Deere's Intelligent Solutions Group testing display software on target. In 2018 I was hired by 
            John Deere as a Systemce Performance Engineer.
